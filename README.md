The Card Designer was a project for Femke Reuvers, a shop specialized in making personalized presents.

The card designer allows users to:
- Add shapes;
- Add text;
- Add their own images through a mobile qr-code or;
- Use preset "sticker" images;
- Change object colors;
- Align objects;
- Design multiple sides of the card;
- Export the result as a PDF.

The designer depends on:
- [Fabric.js](https://github.com/fabricjs/fabric.js) (high-level canvas usage)
- [QRCode.js](https://github.com/davidshimjs/qrcodejs) (generating qr-codes at runtime)
- [jsPDF](https://github.com/parallax/jsPDF) (exporting card as PDF)
- [alwan](https://github.com/SofianChouaib/alwan) (customizable color picker)
